A Lucky Day Reversed

Original Author: Hyun Jin-geon / Adaptation: HOPARKSUNG with Gemini 2.5 / Translation: AI

The sky, grimly overcast, looked like it might snow, but instead, a sleety rain, half-frozen, drizzled persistently.

For Mrs. Park, who made a living as a bundle peddler near Dongsomun Gate, this day, after a long stretch, turned out to be a lucky one. Rising at dawn, she had delivered some ordered vegetables to a gentleman's house in the neighborhood (though it was hardly better than the outskirts). After that, hoping someone might buy something or hire her for an odd job, she lingered at the market entrance, casting almost pleading glances at every passerby. Finally, a man in a Western suit, likely a clerk from the township office, asked her to carry some luggage to his house.

Thirty jeon for the first job, fifty jeon for the second – not a bad start for the morning. Indeed, Mrs. Park, who hadn't seen the color of money for nearly ten days due to sheer bad luck, felt tears well up when the few ten-jeon nickel coins clinked into her palm. She desperately needed this eighty jeon. It meant she could wet her parched throat with a bowl of makgeolli, but more importantly, she could finally buy a bowl of seolleongtang for her ailing husband.

Her husband had been coughing for over a month now. They were so poor they often skipped meals, even of coarse millet gruel, so naturally, they hadn't afforded a single dose of medicine. It wasn't entirely impossible to get some if she tried, but she clung to her belief that pampering an illness with medicine only encourages it to linger. Consequently, having never seen a doctor, she didn't know what ailed him, but seeing him unable to even turn on his side, let alone sit up, it was clearly serious. His condition had worsened drastically ten days ago after eating some millet gruel. Back then, Mrs. Park had managed to earn a little money and bought a measure of millet and a bundle of firewood. According to her, that 'damned husband' had greedily cooked it himself in the pot. Impatient and with a weak fire, the gruel wasn't fully cooked, but he shoveled it down, not even using a spoon, grabbing handfuls so large his cheeks bulged as if someone might snatch it away. That evening, he started complaining of chest pain and stomach cramps, his eyes rolling back wildly. Enraged, Mrs. Park had yelled:

"Agh, you damned man! You truly have no luck! Sick if you don't eat, sick if you do! What am I supposed to do! Why can't you even keep your eyes straight!"
And she had struck her ailing husband's back. His rolling eyes focused slightly, then glistened with tears. Mrs. Park's own eyes had prickled with heat.

Despite this, the patient hadn't lost his appetite. For the past three days, he had been begging his wife for seolleongtang broth.

"You damned man! You can't even keep down millet gruel, but you want seolleongtang? Just so you can eat it and make a fuss again?"
She had scolded him, but her heart ached for not being able to buy it for him.

Now, she could afford the seolleongtang. She could also buy some porridge for three-year-old Gaettongi, who fretted with hunger beside his sick father. With eighty jeon in hand, Mrs. Park felt her spirits lift.

But her luck didn't end there. Wiping the mix of sweat and rain from her neck with a grimy cotton towel, she was turning the corner from the clerk's house when she heard a call from behind: "Madam! Luggage!" She glanced back and saw it was a young student burdened with bundles. He asked her point-blank:

"How much to carry these bags to Namdaemun Station?"
He was likely a student living in a nearby boarding house, heading home for the holidays. He must have decided to leave today but was stuck because of the rain and his many bags, spotting Mrs. Park just in time. Why else would he rush out after her, shoes half-on and dragging, getting his worn student uniform soaked in the rain?

"To Namdaemun Station, you say?"
Mrs. Park hesitated for a moment. Was it because she didn't want to trudge through the mud carrying a heavy load in the rain without even an umbrella? Or was she satisfied with her first two earnings? No, definitely not. Strangely, this continuous stream of good fortune made her a little scared. And her husband's plea from that morning weighed on her mind. When a neighbor woman had come by to help, the sick man, his face gaunt, only bones showing, had looked at her with unusually large, sunken eyes – like the only springs of life left – filled with pleading light.

"Don't go out today. Please, just stay home. I'm so sick..."
He had mumbled like a mosquito buzzing, his breath catching raggedly. At the time, Mrs. Park had brushed it off dismissively:

"Ah, damn it all, what nonsense is this? If we both just sit here, who's going to feed us?"
As she turned to leave abruptly, her husband stretched out an arm as if to grab her.

"I told you not to go... well, then come back early."
His choked voice followed her.

The moment she heard the request to go to the station, the image of her husband's trembling hands, his unusually large eyes, his tearful face, flickered before her.

"So, how much to Namdaemun Station?"
The student asked again impatiently, looking at Mrs. Park's face and muttering to himself, "The train to Incheon leaves at eleven, and the next one is at two, I think."

"One won and fifty jeon, please."
The words slipped out of Mrs. Park's mouth before she knew it. Having named the price, she was startled by the enormous sum. How long had it been since she'd even asked for such an amount at once! The desire to earn that money quickly extinguished her worry for her sick husband. Surely, nothing terrible would happen in just one day, she thought. Whatever happened, she couldn't pass up this fortune, which was more than double her first two earnings combined.

"One won fifty jeon is a bit much."
The student tilted his head, hesitating.

"No, sir. It's easily over ten ri from here. And on a muddy day like this, you should pay a little extra."
A grin spread across Mrs. Park's face, an irrepressible joy shining through.

"Alright, I'll pay what you ask. Let's hurry."
The generous young customer spoke these words and quickly went back into the boarding house to get his things ready.

With the student's luggage hoisted on her back, Mrs. Park's legs felt strangely light. She wasn't just walking; she felt like she was almost flying. Her steps were so swift, it felt less like treading the ground and more like gliding over ice. The frozen ground, slick with rain, contributed to the sensation.

Soon, the weight on her back began to register, and her legs grew heavy. She was nearing her own neighborhood. A fresh wave of anxiety pressed down on her chest. "Don't go out today... I'm so sick..." The words echoed in her ears. She imagined her husband's sunken eyes glaring at her resentfully. Then she thought she heard Gaettongi's wails. She seemed to hear faint, gasping hiccups.

"Why are you so slow? We'll miss the train!"
The student's anxious cry barely registered. Startled, she realized she had stopped dead in the middle of the road, luggage still on her back.

"Yes, yes."
Mrs. Park hurried her steps again. As her home gradually receded behind her, her pace quickened once more, filled with renewed energy. It was as if only by moving her legs quickly could she forget the worries and anxieties constantly surfacing in her mind.

After delivering the luggage to the station and actually holding the astonishing sum of one won fifty jeon in her hand, she forgot the hardship of trekking ten ri through the muddy rain. It felt like a gift, and she was deeply grateful. She felt like a nouveau riche. Bowing several times to the young customer, who was barely older than her own child, she said politely,
"Have a safe trip."

But the thought of returning home empty-handed in the rain was daunting. As the sweat from her labor cooled, a chill began to rise from her famished gut and drenched clothes. Only then did she keenly feel how precious, and how painfully earned, the one won fifty jeon was. Her steps leaving the station were heavy, lacking strength. Her whole body shivered, and she felt she might collapse right there and never get up.

"Damn it all! Walking back empty-handed in this rain. This damn rain, like an old hag's wrinkles, why does it slap my face like this!"
She grumbled furiously, as if in defiance of someone. Just then, a new idea dawned in her mind: 'Instead of just going back, maybe if I hang around here, I might find another job.' Her luck had been strangely good today; who was to say such good fortune wouldn't strike again? She felt a conviction, strong enough to bet on, that more luck was waiting for her. Still, she couldn't stand right in front of the station, fearing the ire of the regular porters and rickshaw pullers. So, as she had done many times before, she settled down on the roadside curb a little away from the tram stop in front of the station, watching the situation unfold. After a while, a train arrived, and dozens of people streamed towards the tram stop. Among them, Mrs. Park, scanning for potential customers, spotted a woman who looked like either a wealthy madam or a modern girl (it was hard to tell the difference these days), dressed in Western clothes, high heels, and even a cape. She sidled cautiously towards the woman.

"Ma'am, need your bags carried?"
The woman, pursing her lips haughtily, didn't even glance at Mrs. Park. Like a beggar, Mrs. Park kept watching the woman's expression.
"Ma'am, I'll do it cheaper than those rickshaw pullers over there. Where are you headed?"
She persisted, reaching tentatively for the handbag the woman was carrying.

"What is this? Don't bother me."
The woman snapped like thunder and turned away sharply. Mrs. Park recoiled, muttering, 'Well, I never!'

The tram arrived. Mrs. Park watched resentfully as people boarded. But her premonition hadn't been wrong. As the packed tram started to move, one passenger was left behind. He was holding an enormous suitcase, likely pushed off by the conductor because his luggage was too big for the crowded tram. Mrs. Park quickly approached him.

"Sir, need help with your bag?"
After some haggling over the price, they agreed on sixty jeon to carry the bag to Insadong. As she shouldered the load, her body felt strangely lighter. And when she later set the bag down, her body felt heavy again, but this time, her heart grew anxious too. Images of her home kept flashing before her eyes, leaving no room for hoping for more luck. She could only curse her legs, which felt like wooden stumps, not her own, and force them into a stumbling run. Her pace was so frantic that a passerby might have worried, 'Is that woman drunk? How can she rush like that on this muddy ground?' The overcast, rainy sky was already dimming, nearing dusk. Only when she reached the front of Changgyeongwon Palace did she pause to catch her breath, slowing her steps. With each step closer to home, her heart strangely began to calm. But this calm wasn't from relief; it came from the fear that the moment of fully realizing the terrible misfortune awaiting her was imminent. She tried to stall, to stretch out the time before confronting the disaster. She wanted to hold onto the joy of her near-miraculous earnings for as long as possible. She looked around, glancing everywhere. It was as if she were pleading, unable to stop her own legs carrying her towards her home – towards misfortune – asking anyone, someone, to grab her, to save her.

Just then, her friend Suni emerged from a roadside tavern. Suni seemed slightly better off than Mrs. Park; her face had some color, and her clothes were neat. In contrast, Mrs. Park's face was sallow and gaunt, etched with lines – a stark contrast.

"Well, look who it is, Mrs. Park! Where are you coming from? Judging by your state, you must have made some money! Come on in for a bowl of makgeolli."
Suni called out cheerfully upon seeing her. Her voice was bright and friendly. Mrs. Park was incredibly glad to see her friend. She felt grateful, as if Suni were a savior.

"Looks like you've already had a few. Business good for you today?"
Mrs. Park managed a smile.

"Ha! As if I need good business to have a drink! But look at you, soaked like a drowned rat! Come on in and dry off."

The tavern was warm and cozy. White steam puffed up every time the lid was lifted from the pot simmering with chueotang (loach soup). On the grill sizzled various meats – beef slices, pork, liver, kidney – alongside dried pollack and bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes)... Seeing the messy spread of appetizers on the table, Mrs. Park suddenly felt an unbearable gnawing in her stomach. If she could, she would have devoured everything there. Famished, she first ordered two large bindaetteok and a bowl of chueotang. Tasting food made her empty stomach roar for more. In an instant, she downed the bowl of soup with tofu and loach as if it were water. As she received her third bowl, two large, warmed bowls of makgeolli arrived. Sharing with Suni, the alcohol hit her empty stomach with a jolt, spreading warmth through her insides and making her face flush. She immediately ordered another large bowl.

Mrs. Park's eyes were already starting to glaze over. She roughly tore the two bindaetteok from the grill, stuffing her cheeks, and called for two more large bowls of makgeolli.

Suni looked at her, surprised.
"Hey, ordering more? We've already had four bowls each! That's forty jeon." She reminded her.

"Ah, what's forty jeon to worry about? I made a killing today! My luck was really something today."
"Oh yeah? How much did you make?"
"Thirty won! I made thirty won! Damn it, why aren't they pouring the drinks...? It's fine, it's fine! I can drink all I want. I made a mountain of money today!"
"Whoa, slow down, you're drunk. Let's stop."
"What are you talking about? You think this little bit makes me drunk? Come on, drink up!"
The drunken woman slapped Suni's shoulder and shouted. Then she turned on the fifteen-year-old boy pouring the drinks.
"Hey kid, you damned brat, why aren't you pouring?" she yelled. The boy grinned sheepishly and glanced at Suni as if asking for guidance. Seeing this, the drunkard flew into a rage.
"You motherless, fatherless little pests! You think I don't have money?"
With that, she fumbled in her waistband, pulled out a one-won note, and slammed it down in front of the boy. A few silver coins scattered with a clatter.

"Hey, you dropped money! Why are you throwing it around?"
Suni said, bending to pick up the coins. Even in her drunken state, Mrs. Park seemed to track the money, her eyes wide as she looked down at the floor. Then, as if suddenly disgusted by her own actions, she shook her head violently and grew even angrier.
"Look! Look here, you filthy things! You think I have no money? I ought to break your legs!"
Taking the coins Suni handed her, she cried out,
"This cursed money! This money fit for the executioner's block!"
And flung them against the wall. The coins bounced off and fell into the pot where the drinks were heated, ringing with a clang as if receiving a just punishment.

Two more large bowls were emptied almost before they were poured. Mrs. Park wiped the makgeolli from her lips and under her nose, then stroked the faint lines around her mouth with deep satisfaction.
"More! Pour more!" she shouted.

After another bowl, Mrs. Park slapped Suni's shoulder and suddenly burst into loud laughter. It was so loud that everyone in the tavern turned to look at her. She laughed even harder.
"Hey, Suni! Want to hear a funny story? You know I carried luggage to the station today."
"And?"
"Well, it felt like a waste just coming back. So I was hanging around the tram stop, looking for more work. And there was this fancy lady, maybe a modern girl – who can tell the difference these days between rich women and young ladies? – standing there in the rain, wearing a cape. I snuck up close and asked, 'Need help with your bags?' and tried to take her handbag. She slapped my hand away, spun around, and snapped, 'Why are you bothering me!' Her voice, I tell you, it was like a nightingale! Ha ha!"
Mrs. Park cleverly mimicked a high, melodious voice. Everyone burst into laughter.
"That damn shrew! As if anyone was doing anything to her. 'Why are you bothering me!' Good grief, that voice! Ha ha!"
The laughter grew louder. But before it could fade, Mrs. Park started sobbing, her shoulders shaking.

Suni stared at the drunkard, bewildered.
"You were just laughing like mad, now what's with the crying?"
Mrs. Park sniffled repeatedly.
"My husband's dead."
"What? Your husband's dead? When?"
"When do you think, woman? Today!"
"Ah, you crazy woman, stop lying."
"Why would I lie? He's really dead, truly... His corpse is lying stretched out at home, and here I am drinking? I'm a wretched woman, wretched!"
And Mrs. Park broke down, wailing loudly.

Suni's cheerful mood dampened slightly.
"Goodness, this woman... Is she telling the truth or lying? Then let's go home, come on."
She grabbed the weeping woman's arm.

Shaking off Suni's hand, Mrs. Park looked up, her eyes swimming with tears, and gave a small smile.
"Who's dead?"
She declared triumphantly.
"Why would he be dead? He's alive and well, that damned man just eats well is all. You fell for it!"
She clapped her hands like a child and laughed.

"Has she really gone mad? I heard your husband was sick, though."
Suni, feeling a flicker of unease, urged her again to go home.
"He's not dead! I told you he's not dead!"
Mrs. Park shouted hotly, her voice full of conviction, yet betraying an undertone of desperation, as if trying to convince herself. They finished off the last bowl each, making it exactly one won's worth of drinks, and left. The miserable rain continued its dreary drizzle.

Even drunk, Mrs. Park remembered to buy the seolleongtang before reaching home. Home, of course, was a rented room; not even a whole house, but a single room in the outer building (haengrangbang), separate from the main house, for which she paid one won a month plus fetching water. If Mrs. Park hadn't been drunk, the terrifying silence that dominated the place as she stepped through the gate – a silence like the sea after a storm – would have made her legs tremble. No sound of coughing could be heard. Not even the rasping sound of breathing. The only thing breaking the tomb-like silence – or rather, deepening it, making it more ominous – was a faint, rhythmic sucking sound, the sound of a baby nursing. A keen ear might have noticed it was only sucking; there was no gulping sound of milk being swallowed, suggesting the baby was nursing on an empty breast.

Perhaps Mrs. Park sensed this ominous silence too. Otherwise, it was strange that, upon entering the gate, she immediately yelled, louder than ever before:
"You good-for-nothing man! Your wife comes home and you don't even come out to see? You blasted man!"
This shouting was surely just bravado, an attempt to dispel the terrifying premonition creeping over her.

In any case, Mrs. Park threw the door open violently. A nauseating stench assaulted her dull senses – the smell of dust from under the worn reed mat, the stink of feces and urine from unwashed diapers, the grime from layers of unlaundered clothes, mixed with the sour odor of the sick man's sweat.

Stepping into the room, before she could even set down the seolleongtang, the drunkard bellowed at the top of her lungs:
"You damned man! Lying around day and night is all you're good for? Your wife comes home and you can't even get up?"
With the words came a vicious kick to the prone man's legs. But what her foot met felt less like human flesh and more like a wooden log. At that moment, the sucking sound turned into a weak whimper. Gaettongi, having lost the nipple, began to cry. But it was more a pained grimace contorting the whole face than a real cry. The whimpering sound seemed to come not from the mouth, but from deep within the belly. The baby had cried until its throat was raw, until it lacked even the strength to cry properly.

Seeing that kicking had no effect, the wife rushed to the head of the pallet, grabbed the patient's hair – truly like a magpie's nest – and shook his head violently.
"You man, speak! Speak! Cat got your tongue, you blasted man!"
"......"
"Huh? Look at this, not a word."
"......"
"You man, are you dead? Why won't you speak?"
"......"
"Huh, still no answer. Maybe you really are dead."
Then, her eyes fell on the man's face, noticing his eyes were rolled back, showing only the whites, staring upwards.
"Those eyes! Those eyes! Why aren't they looking at me? Why are they staring at the ceiling, huh?"
Her voice choked at the end of the sentence. Then, tears like chicken droppings fell from the living wife's eyes, splattering and staining the dead man's stiff face. Suddenly, Mrs. Park, as if possessed, pressed her face against the dead man's, rubbing them together, murmuring:
"I brought seolleongtang, why can't you eat it? Why can't you eat it...? Strangely, today! My luck... it was too good...."
